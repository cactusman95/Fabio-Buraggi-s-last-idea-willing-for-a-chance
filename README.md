My name is Fabio Buraggi, born in 1995.  
This repository is a message, a legacy, and an offering. It’s not about final products — it’s about showing that certain things can be done, even with little, even alone.

Over the years, I’ve travelled, worked in challenging and protected environments, and taught myself to create using only what I had around me. I’ve developed AI, clean energy concepts, liquid semiconductors, mechanical logic. Not for fame — just to prove it’s possible.

I’ve also been involved in politics. I entered with ideals, but I wasn’t prepared for the manipulation, the betrayals — even from those who called themselves allies. I stepped back rather than let it consume me.

Still, I never stopped building. Even surrounded by silence, scarcity, and systems that crush motivation, I kept going. This repository holds fragments of that journey: inventions, ideas, unpolished but alive.

Each one carries a message: **we can do better**. And I want to contribute, wherever that spark is still welcome.
Some call it depression. I've never been diagnosed, though I did try to seek help. But this isn’t something that grew inside me — it’s what grows around you when your environment shuts every door to growth, expression, and dignity. It’s not an illness. It’s a reaction.

Despite everything, my curiosity never died. My mind still works, my hands still build. I don’t want pity, I want to work. I’m open to collaborate with any company **outside Italy**, at any salary they believe reflects what I bring — technical insight, vision, and endurance.

Although I’ve worked for years entirely in English, I asked ChatGPT to help write this. Not because I couldn’t — but because I no longer have the strength to do everything myself. Still, every line here was written and rewritten, word by word, until it fully reflected me.

This repository isn’t a goodbye. It’s a direction — and maybe an invitation.  
If someone sees value in it, I’m ready to move forward. I’m not done yet.
